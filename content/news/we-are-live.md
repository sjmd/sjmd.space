  The Social Justice, Minus Dogma Course + Community is ready for you.
---

For the past few months, I've been working on creating the Social Justice, Minus Dogma Online Course + Community. It's a course (6 weeks, but you're welcome to go at your own pace) + community (private forum online for discussing course materials, then forever-after hub for continued learning and support).

You can read all about it on the [SJMD Landing Page](https://www.sjmd.space), and sign up and start learning with us right now, but I want to share a few key details I'm particularly excited about here as well:

## ✅ Offered in the Gift

Like everything else I do, I refuse to let money to be a barrier to access.

What's this mean here? You choose the tuition level (even $0) the participate in Social Justice, Minus Dogma.

Accessibility is a foundational value of social justice, so anything else feels antithetical to the goals of the work.

## ✅ Uncopyrighted & Open Source

Part of the spirit of the gift, everything I've written for this course is uncopyrighted, and I've open-sourced the entire project.

I wrote the app that powers the course, and that code is all accessible on Github. Want to create a course like this? All yours.

The only thing that's restricted is the community, because...

## ✅ Designed for Anonymity & Safety

Talking about topics like these, online or anywhere, is risky. To help mitigate that risk, I've designed this entire project with safety in mind. All learners will be anonymous to one another, with identities verified by me.

There's even a topic within the first module to help teach you how to navigate this space (and any online community) safely.

## ⏰ And it's ready for you now.

You can sign up on the [Join Page](https://www.sjmd.space/join/) and get started learning within minutes. The community is already happening (I just replied to one of the first threads from a learner there), and we're excited for you to join us.
