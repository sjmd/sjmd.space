title: "Pay More for the Community"
---
First, let us say **thank you** for the generosity expressed by just clicking the link to learn about paying more.

With that said, we hope you won't feel dismayed that **we are not currently allowing for community members to pay more than $100/Month.** We just don't want to create room for that big of a disparity between those who are giving little, and those of you who are giving a lot.

So, for now, we just ask that you enroll at one of the levels available on the [Join Page](https://sjmd.space/join/#sign-up), and focus on making the most out of the community -- learning, teaching, sharing your perspective, and helping to facilitate conversations with others.

That will go a long way.
