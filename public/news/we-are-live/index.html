It&rsquo;s a course (6 weeks, but you&rsquo;re welcome to go at your own pace) + community (private forum online for discussing course materials, then forever-after hub for continued learning and support).</p><p>You can read all about it on the <a href=https://www.sjmd.space>SJMD Landing Page</a>, and sign up and start learning with us right now, but I want to share a few key details I&rsquo;m particularly excited about here as well:</p><h2 id=offered-in-the-gift>‚úÖ Offered in the Gift</h2><p>Like everything else I do, I refuse to let money to be a barrier to access.</p><p>What&rsquo;s this mean here? You choose the tuition level (even $0) the participate in Social Justice, Minus Dogma.</p><p>Accessibility is a foundational value of social justice, so anything else feels antithetical to the goals of the work.</p><h2 id=uncopyrighted-open-source>‚úÖ Uncopyrighted &amp; Open Source</h2><p>Part of the spirit of the gift, everything I&rsquo;ve written for this course is uncopyrighted, and I&rsquo;ve open-sourced the entire project.</p><p>I wrote the app that powers the course, and that code is all accessible on Github. Want to create a course like this? All yours.</p><p>The only thing that&rsquo;s restricted is the community, because&hellip;</p><h2 id=designed-for-anonymity-safety>‚úÖ Designed for Anonymity &amp; Safety</h2><p>Talking about topics like these, online or anywhere, is risky. To help mitigate that risk, I&rsquo;ve designed this entire project with safety in mind. All learners will be anonymous to one another, with identities verified by me.</p><p>There&rsquo;s even a topic within the first module to help teach you how to navigate this space (and any online community) safely.</p><h2 id=and-it-s-ready-for-you-now>‚è∞ And it&rsquo;s ready for you now.</h2><p>You can sign up on the <a href=https://www.sjmd.space/join/>Join Page</a> and get started learning within minutes. The community is already happening (I just replied to one of the first threads from a learner there), and we&rsquo;re excited for you to join us.</p></div></main><div style=height:0;width:0;position:absolute;visibility:hidden></div><script src=js/app.js></script></body></html></body></html>
