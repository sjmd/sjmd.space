This repo powers the landing page for the SJMD Course + Community.

## Hugo

This site is generated with a custom Hugo build, and all the code is open source, and all of the original contributions and uncopyrighted/unlicensed.

If you want to install it locally, or modify it, all you need to do is [follow the basic Hugo install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), then replace your `static`, `layouts`, and `content` folders with what's here.

Run `hugo server` and everything should work no problem.
