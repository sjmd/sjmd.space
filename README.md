## Hugo

This site is generated with a custom Hugo build, and all the code is open source, and all of the original contributions and uncopyrighted/unlicensed.

If you want to install it locally, or modify it, all you need to do is follow the basic Hugo install, then replace your `static`, `layouts`, and `content` folders with what's here.

Run `hugo server` and everything should work no problem.
